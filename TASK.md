# The Triangles
The `bin/triangle.validator.js` module exports a function called `triangleValidator`.

The function accept 3 lengths of triangle sides (sideA, sideB, sideC) and determines whether 
a triangle can be built.

The following messages are logged to console in case if triangle could be built:

- `The triangle is: equilateral`
- `The triangle is: isosceles`
- `The triangle is: versatile`

The following messages are logged to console in case if triangle could **NOT** be built:

- `Not a triangle`
- `Provide exactly 3 parameters`
- `All parameters should be of type number`
- `Triangle side should be greater than 0`

### Task: ***Create unit tests for the function.***

# Remember the BLACK-BOX 
## Do not cheat and do NOT look inside the function.
